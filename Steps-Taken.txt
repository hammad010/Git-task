Created a repo on github with simle file named app.js
I cloned the repo using the link 
Made changes to the file and then i created a new branch called feature and then pushed the file to that branch.
Created the pre-commit hooks that won't allow the commit if there are trailing spaces ore debugging statemnts
merged the branches and then created post-commit hooks that would send any notification to given link
I faced the the following error when i was trying to merge


To https://github.com/hammad010/Git-task.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/hammad010/Git-task.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

I resolved the error. took sometime but resolved.
